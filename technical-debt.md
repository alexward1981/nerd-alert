## Roadmap
v0.0.1 PRE-ALPHA
This version will be a basic list of comics which will be tied to a user account.

v0.0.2 PRE-ALPHA-2
This version will be a more nicely designed version of the same list with the option for a user to add more comics

v0.1.0 ALPHA
This version will contain links to an external comic book database to retreive additional information

v0.2.0 BETA
This version will have an admin backend to allow users to sign-up and create their own accounts.

v1.0.0 RC
This version will be the first version made publicly available it will contain design refinements and will be tied to a production ready server. Here we will also introduce pull lists.

v?.?.? FUTURE RELEASES
The future versions will also have options for comic book retailers to see users pull lists, a user can assign a pull list to a particular vendor and that vendor will receive an email when the users pull-list is modified. The retailer will be able to see a read-only link to their customers pull-lists and send a notification to the user when their list has been dispatched or is reaching the collection deadline.
